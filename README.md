# Algorithms-Project-3-DynamicProgramming

Overview:
  This project requires you to first theoretically solve a dynamic programming problem1 and write a
  program that implements your solution.
  You are only allowed to consult the class slides, the textbook, the TAs, and the professor. In
  particular, you are not allowed to use the Internet. This is a group project. The only
  people you can work with on this project are your group members. This policy is strictly enforced.
  Specifically, you will solve the longest ordered path problem. You will need to find the longest
  path in a given ordered graph, where an ordered graph is a directed graph in which the following
  are true:
  1. The vertices of the graph are numbered 1 to n.
  2. The edges of the graph are numbered 1 to m.
  3. Every edge goes from a vertex with a lower index to a node with a higher index. That is,
  every directed edge has the form (i, j) with i < j.
  Note, your solution to this problem must use dynamic programming. Solutions based on graph
  traversal will not receive credit.

Instructions:
  For the following java project there are two simple steps required to compile/run the program:
	1. javac LongestOrderedPath.java
	2. java LongestOrderedPath
  It's that easy!

Downloads:
  Additionally, it's assumed that the target device is running java 8. If this is not the case, please download java in the following link:
