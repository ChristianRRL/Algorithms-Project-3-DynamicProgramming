Project 3 Report:

1. Describe in English how you can break down the larger problem into one or more smaller problem(s).
This description should include how the solution to the larger problem is constructed
from the subproblems.

2. What recurrence can you use to model the problem using dynamic programming?

3. Prove that your recurrence is correct.

4. Describe a pseudocode algorithm that uses memoization to solve the problem.
